* Overview

cronwrap is a wrapper script for cron jobs, written to mitigate some common
pitfalls of cron jobs on systems I admin, where I tend to not write the jobs
themselves but have to pick up the pieces when things explode.

See <http://www.zomo.co.uk/2010/02/cron/> for more about the motivation, but key aims are

  . prevent multiple runs of the same job piling up by using lockrun(1) to mutex them
  . store output in a timestamped directory
  . make it easy for external monitoring to determine health of cron jobs

Absent from this incarnation are the SNMP and email hooks that other variants enjoy.

Comments and criticism welcome.

* Requirements

  . lockrun (http://unixwiz.net/tools/lockrun.html)
  . for the additional scripts, working fuser, pgrep/pkill and /proc
  . jobs to exit non-zero on error (** rant suppressed **)

* External bits

  . A (heh) cron job to age out old cronwrap logs
  . A monitoring system to care about the FAIL / LOCK markers

* Usage

See comments within cronwrap for details, but here's an example cron.d snippet

  */5 * * * * nobody cronwrap update-local-cache 300 /usr/local/bin/cache-update -v local

* Contents

  cronwrap          - wrapper itself
  show-cronwap-log  - since the output of a running is in a temporary file, it can
                      be hard to find. this script finds it, useful to work out
                      what a long-running job is up to.
  kill-cronwrap-job - kills the the job that cronwrap (and thus lockrun) is managing
                      useful to nuke a wedged job that is holding up
  cronweb.rb        - diddy Sinarta web app to provide a web view on cronwrap status and logs
  check_cronwrap    - a Nagios test to guage the health of cronwrapped jobs

The last three are decidedly less portable than the main cronwrap script.

* Thanks

Steve Friedl's nifty lockrun tool provides an elegant way to lock jobs from overlapping. It's
way better than any homegrown effort of mine. http://unixwiz.net/tools/lockrun.html

This version of cronwrap was written mostly on Deluxe Online's dime, so thanks to them for
